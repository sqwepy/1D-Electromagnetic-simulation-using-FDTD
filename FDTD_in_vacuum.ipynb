    "Now we want to use this derivatives to simplify our maxwell equations. For this we first need to think of a grid in space and time we want to use. One way as demonstrated in the video is to changingly look at H and E with a difference of $\\tfrac{\\Delta x}{2}$ and so we will be looking at H in every half step in time and space and we will look at E on every whole step in time and space. This means that we will start with the initial condition of $E(0)$ and then look at $H(\\tfrac{\\Delta x}{2})$ then look at $E(\\Delta x)$ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing that we now need, is the maxwell equations in 1D as the curl is usually a 3D operator. We now only look at an x polarized electric field, which means $E_y = E_z = 0$ and we will only assume that the EM-wave only propagates in the y direction (k_y). Note that with this the magnetic field obviously has to be polarized in the z direction. With this the curl of the electric field is for example: $$\\nabla \\times E = (0,0,-\\tfrac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y})$$ adn the magnetic field becomes: $$\\nabla \\times H = (\\tfrac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y},0,0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With all of these simplifications our new maxwell equations become:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\boxed{\\;\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial t}=\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\,\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial y}\\;} \\\\[6pt]\n",
    "\\boxed{\\;\\frac{\\partial E_x}{\\partial t}=\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\,\\frac{\\partial H_z}{\\partial y}\\;}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now talk about the last thing missing, the parametrization of the derivatives and the Yee grid.\n",
    "WWe know $H_z(y)$ is defined at half steps $(t + \\tfrac{\\Delta t}{2}, y + \\tfrac{\\Delta y}{2})$ and $E_x(y)$ is defined at whole steps $(t,y)$. Now we just say that $y$ and $t$ can be parametrized with $j\\,\\Delta y$ and $n\\,\\Delta t$ where n and j are independent integer steps. With this we can then say that e.g. $H_z(y + \\tfrac{\\Delta y}{2}) = H_z(\\Delta y\\,(j + \\tfrac{1}{2}))$ and $E_x(y) = H_z(j\\,\\Delta y)$. To simplify this halfstep and step thing we will now just shift the j and n index with $-\\tfrac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With inserting all of this and with a little math we get this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\boxed{\\;H_z(j,n) = H_z(j,n-1)+\\frac{\\Delta t}{\\mu \\Delta y} \\left(E_x(j+1,n)-E_x(j,n)\\right);} \\\\[6pt]\n",
    "\\boxed{\\;E_x(j,n+1) = E_x(j,n) + \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\epsilon \\Delta y} \\left(H_z(j,n)-H_z(j-1,n)\\right)\\;}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "So at every time $n < n_\\mathrm{max}$, we will first calculate every $j$ (for the magnetic field from $0$ to $j_\\mathrm{max}-1$ for the electric field from $1$ to $j_\\mathrm{max}$) and the proceed to the next $n$ until we reach $n_\\mathrm{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The initial values for j = 0 and n = 0 are really important. Usually $E(j=1, n=0) = 0$ and $ B(j=0, n=-1) = 0$, but this can result in everything just being zero, so it depends on the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful thing to think about is the scale, to keep things as realistic as possible, we have the definiton of the speed of light $c$, with it and the definition of $\\mu_0$ we can get our $\\epsilon_0$ via $c = \\sqrt{(\\frac{1}{\\mu_0 \\epsilon_0})}$ and the velocity of the light wave in a medium can obiously then be obtained by looking at the index $n$ of the medium or with the $\\epsilon$ and $\\mu$ of that medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets talk about the stepsize, we can not choose and arbitrary step size, because the step size has obviously some restrains, the stepsize for $\\Delta x$ must be much smaller than the wavelength for example $\\Delta x <= \\frac{\\lambda_\\mathrm{min}}{20}$ the min is only important if we dont look at a monochromatic wave. and with $\\Delta x$ we can now obviously easily calculate the upper limit for $\\Delta t$ with $\\Delta t <= \\frac{\\Delta x}{c}$. Or if we look at an thin film (almost the only thing we can simulate) we also have the additional condition $\\Delta x <= \\frac{d}{20}$, because we obviously want the wave to go through the film and not skip simulating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to define boundary conditions we have to choose $\\Delta t = \\frac{\\Delta x}{c}$ and with this we get the mur absorbing boundary conditions (probably just a periodic condition, because the EMwave is obv. periodic):\n",
    "$$E_x(j=0,n+1) = E_x(j=1,n)$$\n",
    "$$H_z(j_\\mathrm{max,n}) = H_z(j_\\mathrm{max}-1,n-1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now will talk about our source, so we will talk about our initial E-field $E_0(t)$. We can for example take a modulated gaussian wave:\n",
    "$$E_0(t) = \\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(t-t_0)^2}{\\tau^2}\\right)} \\cdot \\sin{(\\omega_0 t)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We then also need $H_0(t)$, but for this we will need to define the Impedance $Z = \\sqrt{(\\frac{\\mu}{\\epsilon})}$, because if we dont introduce that, the waves will propagate in both directions, in the positive and negative directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H_0(t) = \\frac{1}{Z}\\exp{\\left(-\\frac{(t-t_0)^2}{\\tau^2}\\right)} \\cdot \\sin{(\\omega_0 t)} $$\n",
